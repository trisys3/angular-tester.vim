# angular-tester.vim #
A more flexible Angular tester plugin for vim

## Rationale ##
I couldn't find any good Angular plugins for vim related to testing, so I made my own. It is still very much a work in progress, so please keep in mind that things may break or act strangely at any time.

## Test Runner Support ##
This plugin currently supports karma and protractor, only with regards to Angular. If anyone wants to contribute and add in support for other frameworks, please feel free. Otherwise, I will do this when I can.

## Special Thanks ##
This plugin was inspired by, and heavily influenced by, syntastic. In particular, I borrowed many ideas related to the location list, though I tried to make them a little easier to understand.

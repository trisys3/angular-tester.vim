# angular-tester.vim #
A more flexible Angular tester plugin for vim

## Rationale ##
I couldn't find any good Angular plugins for vim related to testing, so I made my own. I saw `test.vim`, by `janko-m`, and will probably borrow some examples. However, this was too complex for me, and did not do everything I wanted. This plugin is still very much a work in progress, and not quite finished yet, so please keep in mind that things may break or act strangely at any time.

## Test Runner Support ##
This plugin currently supports karma and protractor, only with regards to Angular, not ember or any others. It is not quite finished yet. I am accepting pull requests, though as this is my first plugin please be patient.

## Special Thanks ##
This plugin was inspired by, and heavily influenced by, `syntastic`. In particular, I borrowed many ideas related to the location list, though I tried to make them a little easier to understand. Some ideas are also taken from `test.vim`.
